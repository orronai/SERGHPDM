In this project, we leverage the Riemannian geometry of correlation matrices to address the problem of signal enhancement.
In particular, we focus on signal enhancement in the presence of interference sources, which remains a challenging problem.
We develop and analyze new algorithms based on the Riemannian approach rather than the commonly-used Euclidean one.
